 <h2 style="color:#1a94d5">What’s the goal here?</h2>
    
    <p>To conserve and sustainably use the world’s ocean, seas and marine resources.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#1a94d5">Why?</h2>
    
    <p>Oceans are our planet’s life support and regulate the global climate system. They are the world’s largest ecosystem, home to nearly a million known species and
    containing vast untapped potential for scientific discovery. Oceans and fisheries continue to support the global population’s economic, social and environmental needs.
    Despite the critical importance of conserving oceans, decades of irresponsible exploitation have led to an alarming level of degradation. Current efforts to protect key
    marine environments and small-scale fisheries, and to invest in ocean science are not yet meeting the urgent need to safeguard this vast, yet fragile, resource. The
    drastic reduction in human activity brought about by the COVID-19 crisis, while rooted in tragedy, is a chance for oceans to recuperate. It is also an opportunity to chart
    a sustainable recovery path that will ensure livelihoods for decades to come in harmony with the natural environment.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#1a94d5">So what’s the problem?</h2>
    
    <p>The ocean absorbs around 23 per cent of annual CO2 emissions generated by human activity and helps mitigate the impacts of climate change. The ocean has also absorbed
    more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system. Ocean heat is at record levels, causing widespread marine heatwaves, threatening its rich ecosystems and killing
    coral reefs around the world.</p>
    <p>Increasing levels of debris in the world’s oceans are also having a major environmental and economic impact. Every year, an estimated 5 to 12 million metric tonnes of
    plastic enters the ocean, costing roughly $13 billion per year – including clean-up costs and financial losses in fisheries and other industries. About 89% of plastic litter
    found on the ocean floor are single-use items like plastic bags.</p>
    
<img src="IMAGES\GOALS\G-14\E_SDG_action_card_square_14.jpg" width="380" height="380" style="float:right;margin:20px;">

    <p>About 80% of all tourism takes place in coastal areas. The ocean-related tourism industry grows an estimated US$ 134 billion per year and in some countries, the industry
    already supports over a third of the labour force.</p>
    <p>Unless carefully managed, tourism can pose a major threat to the natural resources on which it depends, and to local culture and industry.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#1a94d5">How is the ocean connected to our health?</h2>
    
    <p>The health of the ocean is intimately tied to our health. According to UNESCO, the ocean can be an ally against COVID-19 – bacteria found in the depths of the ocean are
    used to carry out rapid testing to detect the presence of COVID-19. And the diversity of species found in the ocean offers great promise for pharmaceuticals.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, marine fisheries provide 57 million jobs globally and provide the primary source of protein to over 50% of the population in least developed countries.</p>

<h2 style="color:#1a94d5">So what can we do?</h2>
    
    <p>For open ocean and deep sea areas, sustainability can be achieved only through increased international cooperation to protect vulnerable habitats. Establishing comprehensive,
    effective and equitably managed systems of government-protected areas should be pursued to conserve biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for the fishing industry.</p>
    <p>On a local level, we should make ocean-friendly choices when buying products or eating food derived from oceans and consume only what we need. Selecting certified products is
    a good place to start.</p>
    <p>We should eliminate plastic usage as much as possible and organize beach clean-ups.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, we can spread the message about how important marine life is and why we need to protect it.</p>

<h2 style="color:#1a94d5">TARGETS:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>14.1</b> By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution</li><br>
<li><b>14.2</b> By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action
for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans</li><br>
<li><b>14.3</b> Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels</li><br>
<li><b>14.4</b> By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based
management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics</li><br>
<li><b>14.5</b> By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information</li><br>
<li><b>14.6</b> By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries
should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation</li><br>
<li><b>14.7</b> By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable
management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism</li><br>
<li><b>14.A</b> Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines
on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island
developing States and least developed countries</li><br>
<li><b>14.B</b> Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</li><br>
<li><b>14.C</b> Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in UNCLOS, which provides the legal framework for the
conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of The Future We Want</li><br>
