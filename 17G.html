<h2 style="color:#17476b">What’s the goal here?</h2>
    
    <p>To revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#17476b">Why?</h2>
    
    <p>In light of the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships are more important than ever if
    we are to solve the world’s problems. The Sustainable Developmet Goals remain the framework for building back better. We need everyone to come together—governments, civil
    society, scientists, academia and the private sector.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#17476b">Why does this matter to me?</h2>
    
    <p>We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure
    no one is left behind.</p>

<img src="IMAGES\GOALS\G-17\E_SDG_action_card_square_17.jpg" width="380" height="380" style="float:right;margin:20px;">

<h2 style="color:#17476b">How much progress have we made?</h2>

    <p>Support for implementing the SDGs has been steady but fragile, with major and persistent challenges. Financial resources remain scarce, trade tensions have been increasing, and
    crucial data are still lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic is now threatening past achievements, with trade, foreign direct investment and remittances all projected to decline by up to 40% in 2020.</p>
    <p>A growing share of the global population has access to the Internet, and a Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries has been established, yet the digital divide persists.</p>

<h2 style="color:#17476b">As partners, what would we need to do to achieve the Agenda?</h2>
    
    <p>We will need to mobilize both existing and additional resources - technology development, financial resources, capacity building— and developed countries will need to fulfill their
    official development assistance commitments.</p>
    <p>Multistakeholder partnerships will be crucial to leverage the inter-linkages between the Sustainable Development Goals to enhance their effectiveness and impact and accelerate
    progress in achieving the Goals.</p>

<h2 style="color:#17476b">How can we ensure the resources needed are effectively mobilized and monitored?</h2>

    <p>This will be primarily the responsibility of countries. Reviews of progress will need to be undertaken regularly in each country, involving civil society, business and representatives of various
    interest groups. At the regional level, countries will share experiences and tackle common issues, while on an annual basis, at the <fontcolor:"#17476b"><b>United Nations, the High-Level
    Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)</b></fontcolor:>, they will take stock of progress at the global level, identifying gaps and emerging issues, and recommending corrective action.</p>

<h2 style="color:#17476b">What can we do to help?</h2>
    
    <p>Join/create a group in your local community that seeks to mobilize action on the implementation of the SDGs.</p>
    <p>Encourage your governments to partner with businesses for the implementation of the SDGs.</p>
    <p>Register your initiatives on the <u>SDGs Partnerships Platform</u> to inform, educate, network, and be inspired!</p>
