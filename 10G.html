<h2 style="color:#db1769">What’s the goal here?</h2>
    
    <p>To reduce inequalities within and among countries.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#db1769">Why?</h2>
    
    <p>Inequalities based on income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity continue to persist across the world. Inequality threatens
    long-term social and economic development, harms poverty reduction and destroys people’s sense of fulfilment and self-worth. This, in turn, can breed crime, disease and environmental degradation.</p>
    <p>We cannot achieve sustainable development and make the planet better for all if people are excluded from the chance for a better life. And despite some positive signs, inequality is
    growing for more than 70 per cent of the global population, exacerbating the risks of divisions and hampering economic and social development. Furthermore, COVID-19 is hitting the most
    vulnerable people the hardest, and those same groups are often experiencing increased discrimination.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#db1769">What are some examples of inequality?</h2>
    
    <p>Women and children with lack of access to healthcare die each day from preventable diseases such as measles and tuberculosis or in childbirth. Older persons, migrants and refugees face
    lack of opportunities and discrimination – an issue that affects every country in the world. One in five persons reported being discriminated on at least one ground of discrimination prohibited
    by international human rights law.</p>
    <p>Among those with disabilities, 3 in 10 personally experienced discrimination, with higher levels still among women with disabilities, including based on religion, ethnicity and sex, pointing
    to the urgent need for measures to tackle multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.</p>

<h2 style="color:#db1769">How do we tackle discrimination?</h2>
    
    <p>In today’s world, we are all interconnected. Problems and challenges like poverty, climate change, migration or economic crises are never just confined to one country or region. Even the richest
    countries still have communities living in abject poverty. The oldest democracies still wrestle with racism, homophobia and transphobia, and religious intolerance. Global inequality affects us all, no
    matter who we are or where we are from.</p>

<h2 style="color:#db1769">Can we achieve equality for everyone?</h2>
    
    <p>It can - and should be - achieved to ensure a life of dignity for all. Political, economic and social policies need to be universal and pay particular attention to the needs of disadvantaged and
    marginalized communities.</p>

<h2 style="color:#db1769">What can we do?</h2>
    
    <p>Reducing inequality requires transformative change. Greater efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and invest more in health, education, social protection and decent jobs especially
    for young people, migrants and refugees and other vulnerable communities.</p>
    <p>Within countries, it is important to empower and promote inclusive social and economic growth. We can ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of income if we eliminate discriminatory laws,
    policies and practices.</p>
    <p>Among countries, we need to ensure that developing countries are better represented in decision-making on global issues so that solutions can be more effective, credible and accountable.</p>
    <p>Governments and other stakeholders can also promote safe, regular and responsible migration, including through planned and well-managed policies, for the millions of people who have left their homes seeking
    better lives due to war, discrimination, poverty, lack of opportunity and other drivers of migration.</p>
