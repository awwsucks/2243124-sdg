<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">What’s the goal here?</h2>

    <p>To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p>

<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">Why?</h2>

    <p>Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is important to building prosperous societies.</p>
    <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated health systems globally and threatens already achieved health outcomes.</p>
    <p>Most countries, especially poor countries, have insufficient health facilities, medical supplies and health care workers for the surge in demand.</p>
    <p>The pandemic has shown that in rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.</p>
    <p>Concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health; address the growing burden of zoonotic 
    and non-communicable diseases, tackle antimicrobial resistance and environmental factors contributing to ill health</p>

<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">What progress have we made so far?</h2>

    <p>Progress in many health areas, such as in reducing maternal and child mortality, in increasing coverage of immunization, and in reducing some infectious 
    diseases, continues, but the rate of improvement has slowed down, especially during COVID-19 which is overwhelming the health systems globally 
    and threatens health outcomes already achieved.</p>

<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">How can we achieve these targets?</h2>

    <p>Ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies</p>
    <p>Immunization is one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. While vaccination coverage among infants increased from 72 
    per cent in 2000 to 86 per cent in 2018, an estimated 19.4 million children did not receive the essential vaccines during the first year of life. In fact, 
    since March 2020, routine childhood immunization services have been disrupted on a scale not seen since the inception of the Expanded Programme on Immunization in the 1970s.</p>

<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">Does everyone have access to healthcare?</h2>

    <p>In 2017, only around one third to half of the global population was covered by essential health services. If current trends continue, only 39 per 
    cent to 63 per cent of the global population will be covered by essential health services by 2030.</p>
    <p>The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted essential health services around the world. Some services have been suspended to free up resources for COVID-19 
    patients and to reduce the risk of transmission. If universal health coverage is to become a reality by 2030, growth in the provision and use of essential health services 
    must greatly accelerate.</p>

<h2 style="color:#4a9e46">What can I do to help?</h2>

    <p>You can start by promoting and protecting your own health and the health of those around you, by making well-informed choices, practicing safe sex and 
    vaccinating your children.</p>
    <p>You can raise awareness in your community about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people’s right to quality health care 
    services, especially for the most vulnerable such as women and children.</p>
    <p>You can also hold your government, local leaders and other decisionmakers accountable to their commitments to improve people’s access to health and health care.</p>
