<h2 style="color:#27bde0">What’s the goal here?</h2>
    
    <p>To ensure access to safe water sources and sanitation for all.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#27bde0">Why?</h2>
    
    <p>Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right.</p>
    <p>The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year.</p>
    <p>Water is essential not only to health, but also to poverty reduction, food security, peace and human rights, ecosystems and education. Nevertheless, countries face growing 
    challenges linked to water scarcity, water pollution, degraded water - related ecosystems and cooperation over trans - boundary water basins.</p>
    
<h2 style="color:#27bde0">What are the challenges to lack of access to safe water and sanitation?</h2>
    
    <p>In 2017, an estimated 3 billion people worldwide lacked the ability to safely wash their hands at home – one of the cheapest, easiest and most effective ways to prevent 
    the spread of diseases like the coronavirus. </p>
    <p>Water, sanitation and hygiene services are also not always available at medical care facilities: in 2016, one in four facilities around the world lacked basic water supplies, one 
    in five had no sanitation services, and two in five had no soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, at points of care.</p>
    <p>And today, 4.2 billion people are still faced with daily challenges accessing even the most basic of services. Of these, 673 million people practised open defecation</p>
    <p>By managing our water sustainably, we are also able to better manage our production of food and energy and contribute to decent work and economic growth. Moreover, we can 
    preserve our water ecosystems, their biodiversity, and take action on climate change.</p>

<h2 style="color:#27bde0">Are water and climate changed linked?</h2>
    
    <p>Water availability is becoming less predictable in many places. In some regions, droughts are exacerbating water scarcity and thereby negatively impacting people’s health and productivity 
    and threatening sustainable development and 
    biodiversity worldwide.
    <p>Ensuring that everyone has access to sustainable water and sanitation services is a critical climate change mitigation strategy for the years ahead.</p>
    <p>Without better infrastructure and management, millions of people will continue to die every year from water-related diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea, and there will be further
    losses in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, undermining prosperity and efforts towards a more sustainable future.</p>

<h2 style="color:#27bde0">What can we do?</h2>
    
    <p>Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous communities in water 
    resources governance.</p>
    <p>Generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win-win results and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems</p>
    <p>You can also get involved in the World Water Day and World Toilet Day campaigns that aim to provide information and inspiration to take action on hygiene issues.</p>
